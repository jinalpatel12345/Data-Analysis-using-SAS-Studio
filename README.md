Programming for analytics in SAS

The Adventure Works Product Sales Analysis presentation is generated on the SAS Online Demand Studio platform. 
It is divided into four parts: data import, cleaning, joining & merging, and data analysis. 

Results focus on information gathered from the output obtained by writing SAS programs by Group 10.
To launch, we imported the data from the provided Excel file into SAS using Proc Import. 
The SalesOrderDetail worksheet in the Excel file is imported as the SalesOrderDetail dataset in SAS.
